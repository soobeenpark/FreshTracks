# FreshTracks
Automatically update [FRESH]est new Album / Track releases.

# What is this?
On certain reddit subreddits such as r/indieheads, r/hiphopheads, or r/popheads, new music is uploaded by users with a [FRESH] tag in the title. For many users like myself, this is the main source of finding new music. Often times though, it's easy to miss a lot of great new music unless you frequent the subreddit 24/7. Thus, this is an effort to automate pulling all the [FRESH] tracks that get posted and neatly organize them into auto-updating Spotify playlists, one for each subreddit.

# Playlist Design
1. The playlist only includes [FRESH] tracks **up to one week** since first posted to reddit. Older tracks are removed.

2. The tracks in the playlist are **sorted by their number of upvotes** in each reddit post.  <br>
This is a great way to see which of the recent songs are generating the most buzz within each subreddit.

3. The time in which songs were added to the playlist mirrors the **time they were posted on Reddit**. <br>
To sort by recently added date (freshest posted date on Reddit) instead of number of upvotes (default), simply sort by date using the mechanism Spotify provides.

4. The reddit posts tagged [FRESH] are sometimes albums/EPs which contain multiple tracks.  <br>
In which case, **only the most popular track** (according to Spotify's algorithm) from each album exists in the playlist.

5. The playlist gets updated **every hour**. <br>
Every hour:
    - Old stale tracks are removed.
    - New fresh tracks are added.
    - The number of upvotes is refreshed and playlist sorted accordingly.
    - On each [FRESH] post with an album/EP, the most popular song is updated if it has changed within the past hour.\*

<sub><sup>
\* A small caveat as a result is that the "added date" on the Spotify playlist may not 100% accurately represent how fresh the track is. This is because if the most popular track on an album/EP changed, then the older popular track has to be removed and the newer popular track inserted from the playlist, which updates the date added. However, this does not change when the album/EP track gets removed from the playlist, since that date is calculated by the original reddit post's created date. However, these cases are **very rare**.

# Running the script
The script is designed to be run as a cron job every hour.

The script uses a Mongo database to keep track of [FRESH] tracks in the playlist, as well as all tracks that have ever been added (including old stale tracks after they are removed from the playlist). Make sure to have a MongoDB server running before running the script.


Steps.

0. Clone the repository.  <br>
1. Setup the PRAW and Spotipy client IDs and secret keys using `praw.ini` and environment variables.  <br>
2. Install MongoDB server as instructed in their documentation.  <br>
3. Install Python dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Python venv recommended).  <br>
4. Setup cron job to run the script every hour.  <br>


# Dependencies
Built with Python 3.8 in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. <br>

The main dependencies used are:
1. PRAW - Python Reddit API Wrapper
2. Spotipy - Python Spotify API Wrapper
3. MongoDB + PyMongo - To store track and playlist data
4. PyMODM - ODM/ORM-like layer above PyMongo

Please refer to `requirements.txt` to view the full list of dependencies used. <br>

In order to run this script, the username, password, app client\_id, and app client\_secret need to be set in a separate `praw.ini` config file.
